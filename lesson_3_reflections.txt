When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    - I would want to use a remote repository when working on a collaborative/team project and also just as a way to have another
    backup of my code or project.  That way if I ever had to use a different computer I could easily clone the repository from the
    remote and have the files I need.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    - You might want to manually pull changes from the remote because your
    local repository might not be in a good state to introduce new changes.  If
    you were to have automatic pulls from your remote you might end up with some
    new changes that you are not ready for, or that might interfere with code
    you are currently working on.
